## RGB Potentiometers

Please turn these 3 potentiometers all the way to the left. This adjusts the colors to the correct level.

The potentiometers should ideally be removed and their old inputs / outputs be bridged.   
This would correct the RGB termination resistance to the TV standard `75` Ohm.   

With the potentiometers in the path, that termination is closer to `65` Ohm, which results in a slightly darker picture.   
Removing these can be tricky though, since you can't reach the pins with a clipper. Desoldering is recommended.   

```note
This is not a necessary modification though. The brightness can be corrected with the software or on the display.

Here is how the connections can be bridged:
